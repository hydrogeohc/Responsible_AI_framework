# Building Responsible AI: An AI-Driven Framework for Sustainable, Ethical, and Privacy-Preserving IoT Systems

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive framework for developing AI systems within IoT ecosystems, balancing computational efficiency, environmental sustainability, and ethical responsibility. Targeting developers and scientists, it provides a roadmap for deploying IoT systems with AI practices that are ecologically sustainable, privacy-preserving, and ethically sound.

## Framework Components
The framework emphasizes four key components:

1. **Sustainable IoT and AI Practices**  
   - Focuses on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction.  
   - Utilizes AI-driven optimization and tools like **TensorFlow Model Optimization** and **CodeCarbon** for emission tracking.  
   - Implements real-time ML adjustments for dynamic IoT operations.

2. **Ethical AI and Privacy Preservation**  
   - Ensures transparency, fairness, and privacy compliance.  
   - Employs Explainable AI (XAI) with tools like **SHAP** and **LIME**.  
   - Adopts **Federated Learning** using frameworks like **Flower** for collaborative model training without data centralization.

3. **Practical Implementation**  
   - Demonstrates real-world applications in **healthcare** (e.g., federated learning for cancer prognosis models) and **smart cities** (e.g., IoT-based LED streetlights for energy reduction).  
   - Provides case studies showcasing practical deployment.

4. **Open-Source Tools Integration**  
   - Leverages Python packages for robust implementation:
     | Package       | Use Case                          | Example                                  |
     |---------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
     | **Flower**    | Federated learning orchestration | `fl.client.start_numpy_client()`         |
     | **SHAP**      | Model interpretability           |                                          |
     | **CodeCarbon**| Emissions tracking               | `EmissionsTracker()`                     |
     | **PySyft**    | Secure multi-party computation   | `syft.Tensor(secret_data).share()`       |

## Key Features
- **Multidisciplinary Integration**: Combines low-power systems, privacy-preserving ML architectures, and transparent governance.
- **Sustainability**: Aligns IoT/AI solutions with ethical principles and environmental goals.
- **Measurable Performance**: Ensures accountability through benchmarks and emission tracking.
- **Practical Applications**: Focuses on healthcare and urban management use cases.
